## Little Lottery

A simple lottery Web application built with Flask framework.

Some ideas about future improvements:

1. Add some unit tests to the entire application
2. Implement some custom error pages
3. Improve confirmation process by implementing email confirmation
3. Improve the interface by improving styles and interaction
4. Replace templates with Backbone.js, Ember.js, Angular.js or React.js?
5. Add scripts to do database migration and upgrade
6. Deploy your application onto Heroku
